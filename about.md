This blog is maintained by Koen Herten. For the moment I'm a Bioinformatician @ the Genomics Core Leuven, responsible for the non-model organisms. My specialty is de novo assembly (from sequencing to scaffolds), population studies (from sequencing to variants) and differential expression (from sequencing to gene lists). Beside analysis, I program my own tools in various programming languages, and provide help and training for those who need Bioinformatic support.
