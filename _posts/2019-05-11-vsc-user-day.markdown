# HLA-sorter: a Long Amplicon based Clustering Method to identify HLA Alleles


## Koen Herten, Vicky Van Sandt, Aleksander Senev, Greet Peeters, Johan Kerkhofs, Marie-Paule Emonds and Joris R Vermeesch

The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) system encodes the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) proteins. These proteins are responsible for the recognition of self vs non-self. Mismatching HLA between a patient and a donor is therefore a major graft failure in organ and stem cell transplantation.. To reduce graft rejection HLA alleles must optimally matching, requiring full gene HLA genotyping. 

Here we present HLA-sorter, a Python tool, to identify HLA alleles sequenced by PacBio Long Amplicons.
